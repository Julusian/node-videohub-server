This library sets up a TCP server for the [Blackmagic Videohub Control Panel](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicvideohub/techspecs/W-VHB-09) to connect to, so that it can be used as an input source for a nodejs application.

This has only be tested with the old model, the newer model may work but has not been verified.

See the [examples](examples/) folder for help on using this library.
